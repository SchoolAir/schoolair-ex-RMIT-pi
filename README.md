# schoolair-pi

Raspberry Pi gateway for the SchoolAir platform. Handles device registration,
sensor reading, data ingestion to the central server, and local alert detection.

---

## Quick start — fresh Pi

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SchoolAir/schoolair-ex-RMIT-pi/main/schoolair_setup.sh | sudo bash
```

This clones the repo to `/home/admin/schoolair/`, installs dependencies, builds
the SEN6x binaries, configures a Wi-Fi hotspot for first-boot registration,
and enables all systemd services. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

To use a different admin username:

```bash
curl -sSL ... | sudo ADMIN_USER=pi bash
```

### OTA updates — already-deployed Pis

Once a Pi is registered and in the field, the server can push an update without
physical access. Set `SCHOOLAIR_MIN_VERSION` on the server to the new target
version — every Pi will self-update within its next drain cycle (≤ 30 min during
school hours, ≤ 2 h outside them).

**What happens on the Pi:**

1. The drain loop receives `"update_available": true` in the ingest response.
2. It calls `sudo /usr/local/bin/schoolair-update` (pre-approved via sudoers).
3. The wrapper downloads the current `schoolair_setup.sh` from GitHub and runs
   it with `--update`, skipping host-config steps (hostname, apt, I2C, networking).
4. Updated code is deployed, pip deps installed, C binary recompiled if changed,
   and `sen6x.service` + `schoolair.service` are restarted.
5. `.env` and all hardware configuration are left untouched.

**To trigger a fleet update:**

```bash
# 1. Bump VERSION in jobs/ingest.py (e.g. "2.1.0")
# 2. Merge to the main branch
# 3. Set on the server and restart:
SCHOOLAIR_MIN_VERSION=2.1.0
```

**To update a single Pi manually:**

```bash
sudo schoolair-update
```

The DB column `devices.firmware_version` is updated on every ingest so you can
query which Pi is running which version.

## How it works

### Service topology

Six systemd services run on every Pi:

```
sen6x.service            One-shot — runs `sen6x_read --init` at boot. Starts
                         continuous measurement and waits for the first valid
                         sample (fast if sensor already running, up to 75 s
                         cold). schoolair.service depends on it completing.

schoolair-first-boot     One-shot — assigns a unique hostname to cloned images
  .service               (schoolair-YYMDD-XXXX). No-op if already set.

schoolair-launcher       One-shot — waits up to 60 s for a client WiFi
  .service               connection. Connected + AUTH_TOKEN → exits (normal
                         operation). Connected, no token → starts wizard.
                         No connection → brings up AP hotspot + starts wizard.

schoolair-wizard         Browser-based registration + Wi-Fi setup (Microdot,
  .service               port 80). Started on demand. Stops itself after a
                         successful registration; idle-timeout stops it on LAN.

schoolair.service        Main telemetry process (see below). Starts after the
                         launcher exits. Restarts automatically on failure.

schoolair-netwatch       Persistent — monitors WiFi after boot. On uplink loss
  .service               for 2 min, brings up the AP hotspot and wizard. While
                         in AP mode with saved networks, probes for those
                         networks every 5 min (briefly closing the AP during
                         each probe). Closes AP and restarts telemetry on
                         reconnect.
```

### Telemetry process

`main.py` runs two concurrent coroutines:

- **Ingest loop** — reads the sensor on a clock-aligned schedule (5 min during
  the active window, 15 min outside it), buffers readings in RAM, and drains
  them to the server in batches. When a reading breaches a threshold it launches
  a shared two-stage verification task (see below) to distinguish spikes from
  real events before sending an alert.

- **Microdot server** — lightweight local web server (port 8080). Serves the
  real-time dashboard at `/` and pushes live sensor state over WebSocket at
  `/ws`. nginx on port 80 proxies to this once the device is registered.

### Buffer strategy

The ingest loop is RAM-first: up to 500 readings are held in memory. SQLite is
only written when the server is unreachable **and** the RAM buffer is full. On
reconnect the next drain sends both the SQLite backlog and the current RAM
buffer in a single batch. On clean shutdown (`systemctl stop`, `sudo reboot`)
both in-memory buffers (measurements and alerts) are flushed to SQLite before
exit.

### Alert verification

When a reading breaches a threshold the ingest loop launches a single background
task that covers **all** metrics that breached in that same read. A shared sensor
read is taken once per timing point, with each metric evaluated against that
single reading — if both CO2 and temperature are high at the same time, the four
verification reads are taken once total, not once per metric.

**Timing:**

```
T        Original breach reading (already in buffer)
T+10s    Stage 1 read 1
T+30s    Stage 1 read 2       ← stage 1 complete
T+1m     Stage 2 read 1
T+2m     Stage 2 read 2       ← stage 2 complete (~2 min total)
```

**Severity scoring (integer 0–7):**

The `severity` field on the original reading at T encodes how many timing points
confirmed the breach. It is set to 0 on every reading and updated when the
verification task completes.

| Points | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| +1 | Stage 1 task launched (always — baseline for any breach event) |
| +1 | T+10s: any breaching metric still near/above its threshold |
| +1 | T+30s: any breaching metric still near/above its threshold |
| +2 | T+1m: any breaching metric still near/above its threshold |
| +2 | T+2m: any breaching metric still near/above its threshold |

Maximum is 7 (all timing points confirmed). `severity >= 4` means at least one
stage-2 read confirmed the breach — an alert is sent immediately per metric.

**Outcomes and what reaches the server:**

| Severity | Interpretation | Readings sent |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| 0 | No breach | Original reading |
| 1 | Fluke — stage 1 fired, both reads clear | Original reading with severity=1; verification reads dropped |
| 2–3 | Momentary — stage 1 confirmed, stage 2 clear | Original reading with severity; T+1m reading added to buffer to show recovery; other verification reads dropped |
| ≥4 | Persistent — stage 2 confirmed | Original reading with severity; per-metric alerts sent; all verification reads dropped |

The original reading is never modified beyond having its `severity` field set.
The raw sensor values at T are always preserved exactly as measured.

### Drain timing

Drains are event-driven: the read loop triggers a drain whenever the time since
the last drain would exceed the configured interval if the current read were
skipped. This guarantees drains happen *within* the configured window (25–30 min
active, 105–120 min idle) without a separate polling timer.

---

## First boot — registration

On first boot the launcher detects no `AUTH_TOKEN` and starts the wizard.
Connect to the `SchoolAir_Setup` Wi-Fi hotspot or navigate to
`http://schoolair-register.local` on the same network. The wizard guides you
through:

1. Device registration with the SchoolAir server
2. Wi-Fi configuration (connects the Pi to the school network)

After registration the wizard writes `AUTH_TOKEN` to `.env`, restarts
`schoolair.service`, and exits. nginx activates to proxy port 80 → port 8080.

## WiFi loss recovery

The `schoolair-netwatch` service handles network loss **after boot** without
requiring a reboot.

```
uplink lost
    │
    ▼ (2-minute grace period — ignores brief blips)
    │
    ▼
AP + wizard started
    │
    ├── user connects to SchoolAir_AP and reconfigures WiFi via wizard
    │       └── uplink restored → AP closed → telemetry restarted
    │
    └── no manual action taken
            │
            ▼ (every 5 minutes, if saved networks exist AND no client on AP)
            briefly close AP → try each saved network profile → reopen AP if failed
            │
            └── saved network available → AP closed → telemetry restarted
```

**Grace period (2 min):** Brief WiFi blips — DHCP renewal, AP restart — don't
trigger the fallback.

**Reconnect probe:** While the AP is up, the watchdog checks every 5 minutes
whether any of the Pi's saved WiFi profiles are now reachable. The AP drops for
about 10 seconds during each probe. If a client is currently connected to the
AP hotspot, that probe cycle is skipped so as not to interrupt an active wizard
session.

**Timing overrides** (useful when testing):

| Env var              | Default | Meaning |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| `NETWATCH_POLL`      | `30` s  | Connectivity check interval |
| `NETWATCH_GRACE`     | `120` s | Uplink-loss grace period before AP mode |
| `NETWATCH_RECONNECT` | `300` s | Interval between reconnect probes in AP mode |

## Local development

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set SERVER_URL and optionally DEVICE_NICKNAME
```

Run with the mock sensor (no Pi hardware needed):

```bash
MOCK_SENSOR_SCRIPT=./scripts/mock-sensor.sh python main.py
```

Run with the real sensor bridge (Pi only):

```bash
python main.py   # uses read-sensor.sh by default via MOCK_SENSOR_SCRIPT in .env
```

For one-off sensor checks:

```bash
bash scripts/preview.sh
```

---

## Configuration

`config/settings.json` controls the active window — the period during which the
Pi reads and drains at the higher cadence (school hours).

```json
{
    "active_window": { "start": "07:00", "end": "16:00" }
}
```

- Window boundaries must be on a 15-minute mark (`:00`, `:15`, `:30`, `:45`).
- Maximum window length is 9 hours.
- Read and drain intervals are fixed in source (`jobs/ingest.py`) and
  overridable via env vars for testing:

| Env var                  | Default   | Meaning                        |
|--------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| `READ_INTERVAL_ACTIVE`   | `300` s   | 5 min — sensor read cadence inside the window  |
| `READ_INTERVAL_IDLE`     | `900` s   | 15 min — sensor read cadence outside the window |
| `DRAIN_INTERVAL_ACTIVE`  | `1800` s  | 30 min — max time between drains inside the window |
| `DRAIN_INTERVAL_IDLE`    | `7200` s  | 2 hr — max time between drains outside the window  |

---

## Testing

110 tests. All pass on a laptop except one hardware test that requires a real
SEN6x sensor connected via I2C on a Pi.

```bash
cd schoolair/        # repo root
pytest -m "not hardware"    # laptop-safe (102 tests)
pytest                      # full suite — Pi only
```
